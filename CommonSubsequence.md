# Common Subsequence
You are given two sequences. Write a program to determine the longest common subsequence between the
two strings (each string can have a maximum length of 50 characters). NOTE: This subsequence need not be contiguous.
The input file may contain empty lines, these need to be ignored. The first argument will be a path to a filename
that contains two strings per line, semicolon delimited. You can assume that there is only one unique
subsequence per test case.
