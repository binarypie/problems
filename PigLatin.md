# Pig Latin #

> Write some code that translates a string (word, sentence, or paragraph) into “pig-latin” using the following rules.

* Words that start with a consonant have their first letter moved to the end of the word and the letters “ay” added to the end.
* Words that start with a vowel have the letters “way” added to the end.
* Words that end in “way” are not modified.
* Punctuation must remain in the same relative place from the end of the word.
* Hyphens are treated as two words
* Capitalization must remain in the same place.
* Single letters are not modified.
